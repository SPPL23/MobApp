> [!CAUTION]
> Following the requirements for our Final Output for Mobile App Development
> The group is required to create an APP that is either related to the previous Mid Terms Output or another SDG *Sustainable Development Goals*
---
> [!NOTES]
> Currently, the mobile app has 3 navigation buttons at the bottom.
> 1. The main page currently exists, but only contains Cards, and Strings of random facts/trivia about E-Waste
> 2. The other two buttons are currently used as a placeholder.
>  - Initially, the second button was supposed to be a simple Recycle or Dispose game
>  - Random words related to E-waste will appear and the user will either press Dispose or Recycle
>  - The supposed utilization was to use the userPreferences Module for the score saving.
>  - However, the code did not run as expected and have decided to leave second button as a placeholder for the time being.
